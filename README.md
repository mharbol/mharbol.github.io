# Marcus Harbol's Personal Website
Trying out [Astro](https://astro.build/) as I make my [personal website](https://mharbol.github.io/).
Please feel free to check out my repos, source code, and highlighted projects.
If it looks like this site that was made by a mathematician working as a backend Java engineer... you are totally right.
