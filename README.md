# Marcus Harbol's Personal Website
Trying out [Astro](https://astro.build/) as I make my [personal website](https://mharbol.github.io/).
Please feel free to check out my [repos](https://github.com/mharbol?tab=repositories),
source code, and highlighted projects.
If it looks like this site that was made by a mathematician working as a backend Java engineer
turned C++ engineer... you are totally right.
