# Marcus Harbol's Personal Website
Trying out [Astro](https://astro.build/) as I make my [personal website](https://mharbol.github.io/).
Please feel free to check out my [repos](https://github.com/mharbol?tab=repositories),
source code, and highlighted projects.
If it looks like this site that was made by a mathematician working as a backend Java engineer
turned C++ engineer... you are totally right.

## Design Decisions
This website is supposed to be a gallery of myself and my work;
while I will maintain the projects to varying degrees,
how I showcase them should be straightforward and not require active maintenance.
I was inspired by [this article](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/web-components-will-outlive-your-javascript-framework/)
as brought to light by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vF6puwX3bE) and am using them as inspiration.
