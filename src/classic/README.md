# Classic Mode
On June 8, 2024 we decided to make a "classic mode" of the site to save a snapshot of its terrible roots.
Here are faithful copies of the truly atrocious components, layouts, and lack of style used in the
early skeleton of this project which was public for way too long.
I thought publishing an awful website would be a motivation to swiftly complete it, but it stood in this state for almost a year.
This way of preserving an early iteration is probably going to be a staple of new websites to come,
whether or not I choose to add a "classic" link in the modern page or not.
